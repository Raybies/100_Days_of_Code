# Mathematical Operators
# + - [plus/minus]
# * [multiply]
# / [divide] Note always returns type of float
# ** [exponent] 2 ** 2 = 4

# When on same line of code follows the order of operations
#PEMDAS (order of operation)
# (), **, *, /, [left priority on */] +, - [left priority on +-]
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
# 7 = (3 * 3) + (3 / 3) -3 
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
